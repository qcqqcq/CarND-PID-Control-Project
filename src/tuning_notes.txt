Reflection
==========

Tried manual tuning from some guessed value, but that failed to get the car moving even a few seconds.  Then started with the values from the class lectures.  That was better.  Then did manual tuning. Tried to make it quantitative (records below) but later just went by feel.

* Kp: After struggling with too high of a KP for a while, I landed on 0.25. Higher values made the turns aggressive and unstable.
* Ki: Kept this low.  Tried increasing it a bit, but causes instability
* Kd: Kept this value high to try and dampen out the oscilations.

Unstable early

  double Kp = 0.5;

Works!
